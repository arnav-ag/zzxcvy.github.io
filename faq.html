    <h4><u>How much do the Premium tiers cost?</u></h4>
    <p>FREE</p>
    <h4><u>I'm trying to buy but I keep getting errors</u></h4>
    <p>/USE_BRAIN</p>
    <h4><u>Why is token X showing 9999% gain?</u></h4>
    <p>This coin might still have both V1 and V2 liquidity on PancakeSwap, with one of them being much lower than the other: this provokes huge blips (that you can often see on the charts). Another possible reason is that the coin has been rug pulled. When the scammer steals the liquidity, it makes the PancakeSwap pair ratio skyrocket, but nobody can sell anymore and the token is basically dead.</p>
    <h4><u>Why is the contract ownership not renounced?</u></h4>
    <p>Real project do not renounce their contracts. Have a look at PooCoin, Euler, Tcake, or even SafeMoon. This is not being rug pulled don't worry, the liquidity is locked. Also the mint function has been removed.</p>
    <h4><u>Why don't I see token X in my wallet?</u></h4>
    <p>There is no function on the blockchain to know which tokens are held at a particular address. BSCScan knows an approximate because they have a server that parses all token transfers and keeps the counts (and missing tokens obtained from reflection for example).</p>
    <p>How we do it: we ask your wallet's balance to each of the tokens that are currently loaded in your session. The loaded tokens are all the tokens that had a buy/sell since you opened the website, plus 10 minutes history at start.</p>
    <p>We get how this behavior can be confusing and we are looking for an alternative way to do it in the future.</p>
    <h4><u>Why are the 30m/60m columns at 0,0% when I open the website?</u></h4>
    <p>When the app is opened, it loads a 10min price history. It could go to 60m history but it would be a lot of data to load and would not be reasonnable (both for your bandwith and the BSC node that gives the data). The system could be improved in the future to remove this limitation.</p>
    <h4><u>Why are the marketcaps sometimes different than on PooCoin?</u></h4>
    <p>This is because PooCoin substracts the value owned by 0xdead, 0x0000, 0x0001. This would be too many requests to make on Moonarch with the current system, because we show hundreds of coins at the same time. But we will be able to do it with the future infrastructure.</p>
